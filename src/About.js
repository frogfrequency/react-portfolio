// what do we want to put on the about page


// this react page's primary purpose is to showcase my coding projects in a neat way. 
// it should facilitate your exploration of my projects and i hope being able to try the projects out directly without 
// needing to clone any repos saves you some time
// however this react "page/site ??" (WIE SAIT MO DA??) is not a coding portfolio page in the classical sense.
// i deliberately omitted any personal info since you should already have received that via my application

// I did not use any design/style templates because i wantet to experience and go through the whole process of creating a page from scratch
// i also aimed for a more classical website-style other than most modern websites
